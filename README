Compile/Run Instructions:
javac *.java
java -cp .:mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar InnReservations

Notes: 
- the Makefile compiles and runs when 'make' is run in the directory
- this system assumes that no tables can possibly exist in the working database
  other than "myRooms" and "myReservations" 

  exist in the database at any
