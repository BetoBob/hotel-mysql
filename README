Compile/Run Instructions:
javac *.java
java -cp .:mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar InnReservations

Notes: 
- the Makefile compiles and runs when 'make' is run in the directory

    General:
    - I noticed the clear screen method is commented out, 
        - does this mean we aren't expected to clear screen (I'm guessing for your test suite)?
    - should we assume that there are no other tables than room/reservations in the database?

    Admin:
        AR-1. Status:
            complete
        AR-2 Table Display:
        AR-3 Clear database (removes tuples from tables -> empty database): 
            complete
        AR-4 Populate the database: 
            complete
        AR-5 Database removal (remove tables -> no database):
            complete
        AR-6 switch subsystem (just the back button): 
            complete

        - AR-3 and AR-6 functions can be combined (time permits)
        - AR-4 method might be slow (reading from .sql query file)
