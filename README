Compile/Run Instructions:
javac *.java
java -cp .:mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar InnReservations

Notes: 
- Don't change print statements in InnReservations.java (for grading)

Questions:

    General:
    - Why and where do I check INN database being full?
        - after each while loop?
        - isn't this already done in ADMIN subsystem? What's the difference?
        
    - I noticed the clear screen method is commented out, 
    does this mean we aren't expected to clear screen (I'm guessing for your tester)?

    Admin:
        AR-1: 
            - status is for database in ServerSettings?
            - can we hardcode the database we are using (i.e. 'rehensle')?
            - how do we find no database case? 
        AR-2:
